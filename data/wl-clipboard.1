.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwl-copy\fR copies the given \fItext\fR to the Wayland clipboard.
If no \fItext\fR is given, \fBwl-copy\fR copies data from its standard input.
.PP
\fBwl-paste\fR pastes data from the Wayland clipboard to its standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--primary
Use the "primary" clipboard instead of the regular clipboard. This uses the private
GTK+ primary selection protocol. See
.UR https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/PrimarySelection
the GNOME Wiki page on primary selection under Wayland
.UE
for more details.
.TP
\fB-o\fR, \fB--paste-once
Only serve one paste request and then exit. Unless a clipboard manager
specifically designed to prevent this is in use, this has the effect of clearing
the clipboard after the first paste, which is useful for copying sensitive data
such as passwords. Note that this may break pasting into some clients, in particular
pasting into XWayland windows is known to break when this option is used.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--foreground
By default, \fBwl-copy\fR forks and serves data requests in the background; this
option overrides that behavior, causing \fBwl-copy\fR to run in the foreground.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--clear
Instead of copying anything, clear the clipboard so that nothing is copied.
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--no-newline
Do not append a newline character after the pasted clipboard content.
.TP
\fB-t\fI mime/type\fR, \fB--mime-type\fI mime/type
Override the inferred MIME type for the content.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
WAYLAND_DISPLAY
Specifies what Wayland server \fBwl-copy\fR and \fBwl-paste\fR should connect to.
This is the same environment variable that you pass to other Wayland clients,
such as graphical aplications, that connect to this Wayland server. It is normally
set up automatically by the graphical session and the Wayland compositor. See
.BR wl_display_connect (3)
for more details.
.TP
WAYLAND_DEBUG
When set to \fB1\fR, causes the \fBwayland-client\fR(7) library to log every
interaction \fBwl-copy\fR and \fBwl-paste\fR make with the Wayland compositor to
stderr.
